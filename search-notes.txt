how to find the index with a search algorithm

you enter a search term into a form field, press enter and the results appear!! hooray, SEARCH!

we need some data to search by. name, id, characters

linear search—march linearly through the list and check for validity of each item
binary search—

given item to search: name="carlos" in a list 100 items long
list.length/2 = start point
item[name="carlos"].index <= 50 ? repeat between 0-50 : repeat between 51-100
